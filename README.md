# Capstone Project - Flatiron School's Immersive Data Science Program


## Backstory
The news pace these days is a mile a minute. Stories fly past our eyes - constantly rolling along the bottom of CNN or Fox, constantly showing up in our feeds as we scroll through Facebook, constantly bombarding us with whatever new thing we should worry about now.

As a voracious news reader with a Master's in International Affairs, I occasionally will get out-of-the-blue messages from old high school friends, brief acquaintances from old jobs, the strangers I've met who've kept in touch, all concerned about something they read in the news and wondering if I'm as worried as they are. 

A recent example: in 2017, news about North Korea's nuclear program was everywhere. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July, 2017, and a third in November, 2017, which was remarkable since it meant that North Korean missiles could now theoretically reach most of the continental United States. 

If you've forgotten the hype, here are some reminders: 

- "North Korea Fires Another Missile, Its Latest Step Toward Putting the U.S. Within Reach" ([Washington Post, July 28, 2017](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/north-korea-fires-another-missile-its-latest-step-toward-putting-the-us-within-reach/2017/07/28/7fc4437a-71fd-11e7-8c17-533c52b2f014_story.html)) 
- "North Korea Launches Another Missile, Escalating Crisis" ([New York Times, September 14, 2017](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/asia/north-korea-missile.html))
- "North Korea: 'Nuclear War May Break Out Any Moment'" ([Fox News, October 17, 2017](https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-korea-nuclear-war-may-break-out-any-moment))
- "New Missile Test Shows North Korea Capable of Hitting All of US Mainland" ([CNN, November 30, 2017](https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/28/politics/north-korea-missile-launch/index.html))

That hype also prompted a [quite frankly gorgeous investigation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-16/north-korea-missile-range-map/8880894) of the reach of North Korean missiles by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, last updated in May 2019 if you're curious today.

Scary stuff! To the point that people came out of the woodworks to ask me if they should be worried about nuclear war, knowing I was studying nuclear politics and history in my Master's program. My answer, for the record, was always a resounding "probably not, we're probably fine" (reassuring, right?).

But two years have passed since those first missile tests. Were we ever really close to a nuclear war? Should I have reacted any differently? How often does news hype about an event actually correspond with terrible things that happen around the globe?

These questions have prompted me to analyze the intersection of what people worry about, what the news media hypes up, what experts warn us about, and what actually happens.

## The Data


## The Inspiration

["Death: Reality vs Reported"](https://owenshen24.github.io/charting-death/) was a project done by Owen Shen, Hasan Al-Jamaly, Maximillian Siemers and Nicole Stone, which resulted in a [visualization](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/8cwcbu/cause_of_death_reality_vs_google_vs_media_oc/) I first found in the Subreddit dataisbeautiful's top posts of all time aggregator. The way they asked their questions, aggregated their data, and visualized it prompted me to think about the same questions, but for international affairs. Tip of the hat, esteemed data science colleauges, I appreciate the jumping off point and inspiration!
