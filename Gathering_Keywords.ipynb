For example, we need to explain that 'Central African Republic' is one thing, and that when we break down the words in our descriptions into tokens, it shouldn't break apart 'Central' 'African' and 'Republic' and look at each word separately. Additionally, we need to make sure that \"China\", \"PRC\" and \"Sino\" are all considered the same thing. So we need to do some preprocessing for the words in each description, so we can do some reasonable analysis when we search for keywords later."
